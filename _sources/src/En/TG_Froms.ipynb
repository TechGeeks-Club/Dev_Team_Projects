    "\n",
    "In the current academic environment, 3rd & 5th year university students are required to conduct research and data collection as part of their graduation projects. Typically, students rely on Google Forms to gather data relevant to their studies. However, once the data is collected and the project is completed, the information is neither stored nor shared for potential reuse. This results in a significant duplication of effort as students working on similar projects must repeatedly collect data that has already been gathered by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.2 Project Overview :\n",
    "\n",
    "**TG Forms** aims to address this issue by providing a centralized platform for university students to create, manage, and store data collection forms. This platform will enable students to access previously collected data that is relevant to their research, thereby saving time, minimizing redundant efforts, and creating a valuable repository of information for future academic use. The long-term goal is to establish a comprehensive dataset that will benefit students undertaking similar projects in subsequent years."
