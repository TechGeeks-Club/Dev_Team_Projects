    "## I. Background & Problem Statement :\n",
    "  \n",
    "In todayâ€™s digital landscape, social media is essential for customer engagement and feedback, yet managing messages across multiple platforms presents significant challenges for social media managers and customer support teams. The current need to switch between platforms to address inquiries is inefficient, leading to delays, missed messages, and inconsistent responses, which can harm customer satisfaction and brand reputation. A centralized solution to view, manage, and prioritize social media messages would streamline communication, enabling timely, organized responses that enhance engagement and improve the overall customer experience across social channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Project Overview :\n",
    "\n",
    " is a specialized social media message management system designed to centralize all communications from various social media platforms into a single, unified inbox. By aggregating messages, comments, and mentions, this system enables users to view, prioritize, and respond to audience interactions seamlessly, without switching between social media apps. The platform is ideal for businesses and individuals who need to handle high volumes of social media messages efficiently and stay responsive to their audience."
