    "Beginners in programming, especially first-year students in the computer science field, generally face challenges in understanding algorithms and often confuse them with programming languages. This confusion acts as a barrier to effectively learning the fundamentals of programming.\n",

    "### I.2 Project Overview:\n",
    "**TG Blocks** is a platform aims to bridge the gap between algorithms and programming languages. It offers a visual representation of algorithms alongside their corresponding code in multiple programming languages. This platform will assist beginners in understanding the logic behind algorithms without the complications of programming language syntax and without the distraction of compiler errors.\n"
