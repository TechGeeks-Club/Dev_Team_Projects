    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.1 Project Title\n",
    "*Automata Simulator*\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.2 Background & Problem Statement\n",
    "In the field of computer science, automata theory is foundational yet lacks accessible and user-friendly digital tools for drawing and simulating automata. The few existing tools are often either complex to navigate or insufficiently flexible, making them impractical for students or professionals needing to model and experiment with different types of automata. To address this gap, we aim to develop a free online platform designed specifically for creating, editing, and simulating automata with an emphasis on usability, flexibility, and practical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.3 Project Overview\n",
    "The Automata Simulator platform will offer users an interactive and intuitive environment to build and test automata. It will enable users to define states, transitions, and symbols easily, as well as visualize the automata's behavior with specific inputs. By *supporting the conversion of non-deterministic automata (NFA) to deterministic automata (DFA)* and providing options for exporting automata diagrams, this tool will serve as a versatile resource for learning and experimentation in automata theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Objectives of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### II.1 Functional Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an interactive interface where users can easily create, modify, and manage automata diagrams.\n",
    "Support a wide range of functionalities, including:\n",
    "Symbol declaration (e.g., alphabet letters = {a, b, câ€¦}).\n",
    "State and transition labeling.\n",
    "Automata simulation with visualized paths and outputs based on user input.\n",
    "Enable users to export their automata in multiple formats, such as PNG, SVG, and JSON, for seamless integration into academic or professional presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II.2 Educational and Practical Objectives\n",
